				This website is intended to showcase the work done by a team of students from The Norwegian University of Science and Technology in January 2015. The work was done in a mandatory course called Experts in Teamwork (EiT) and nineteen students were brought together from diverse fields of study to put their skills to work in an interdiciplinary group. The work resulted in a collection of reports, a short movie, a presentation, an online interactive map and this website.

			    <h2>What?</h2>
				<p>
				Experts in Teamwork, <a href="http://www.ntnu.edu/eit">EiT</a> is an interdiciplinary course at the
Norwegian University of Science and Technology (<a href="http://www.ntnu.edu">NTNU</a>). It is mandatory
for all master level students. The students can apply to take part in one of several "villages", which then consists of the students, two village supervisors and two learning assistants. The course is designed to allow students to learn teamwork skills and prepare them for working life, and therefore consists of two equally important parts. One half of the course is dedicated to learning how to work in teams, through teamwork exercises, personal reflection, group discussions and of course working on the subject at hand in teams. The second half of the course is what is alluded to in the name of the village; namely a project that the students are expected to collaborate on solving, working in groups and applying the skills they have gathered through their years at the university.
The topic for this particular village was "Building Resilience to Urban Disaster: Trondheim Live Project". The objective was to learn about ways to make cities and communitites resilient against disaster and conducting research to assess how Trondheim is prepared and come up with six measures which could improve Trondheims resilience.

				<h2>Why?</h2>
				<p>
				For anyone who is familiar with Trondheim, the question you might be asking now is "why?" Why perform a study to see how well prepared and resilient Trondheim would be in the case of an urban disaster? Isn't Trondheim a safe city in one of the safest countries in the world? That might be the case, but it is still important to be aware of the possibilities that something serious <em>might</em> happen, instead of walking around believing it never <em>can</em> happen. Besides, a theoretical study meant to teach students teamwork and real-life work skills doesn't neccessarily need to be a relevant study, but in our case it actually is. The village topic was inspired by the Rockefeller Foundation campaign <a href="http://www.100resilientcities.org">100 Resilient Cities</a> and the project was intended to attempt to identify possible challenges and threats that Trondheim as a city may face in the coming years, as it continues to grow and evolve in an everchanging world. The words "urban disaster" in the project title might conjure up images of buildings or entire cities ravaged by natural events like earthquakes, tornados or major fires. While there is always a risk of a "natural" disaster happening in Trondheim, severe natural disasters are quite rare in Norway and, as we discovered, the local and national governments already do a lot of work in the areas of risk assessment and risk mitigation when it comes to events such as fire, flood and landslides. However, building a resilient city requires more than just following modern building codes to build earthquake resistant buildings; a disaster doesn't always cause, or get caused by, physical destruction. Disasters can also be of a social or economical kind. The Rockefeller Foundation describes city resilience as <em>"... the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience."</em>

			    <h2>Who?</h2>
				<p>
				Our EiT-village consisted of nineteen students from a broad selection of study fields; everything from architecture students to students of childhood studies, real estate development, contemporary art, german grammar and informatics. As this was an English-speaking village, the students came from such diverse places as Uganda, Norway, Spain, Egypt and Germany, though the majority were Norwegian. There were two learning assistants with us every day for the three weeks the course lasted, and their main task was assist in the group theory part of the course, and facilitate teamwork exercises, group discussions etc. as well as functioning as representatives for the course staff.
Our village supervisors were David Sanderson and Vilde Ulset who were responsible for facilitating the work on the project itself. They introduced us to several useful toolsets, such as PRA-tools, and David held several short seminars related to aid work in the developing world, which all of us found highly interesting and gave us a glimpse into a world we rarely encounter.

			    <h2>How?</h2>
				<p>
				Our group of nineteen students were divided into four subgroups which each focused on their seperate part. We all agreed on the different tasks that were to be divided between the groups, and then each group chose the tasks they wanted to work on. One group had a look at historical events in Trondheim to get an understanding for what hazards and risks Trondheim has been facing through the years, as well as interviewing key informants in order to gather information on the current state of preparedness and what were officially viewed as possible threats. Another group researched city fires and quick clay slides, events that Trondheim has seen its fair share of through its history. We also had a group investigating a part of the city called "Svartlamoen", an area in Trondheim with experimental urban housing, mainly inhabited by self-proclamied socialists and anarchists. This was an areas we all thought would be one of the most vulnerable areas in Trondheim, but it turned out it might just be one of the more resilient ones. The last group focused on the different social institutions in Trondheim, that provide services like food, clothing, counseling and moral support to the less fortunate inhabitants in the city. Organisations such as the Salvation Army, Kirkens Bymisjon, 22B and similar, all do very important work and offers help to those in need. Our work therefore focused both on the possible natural disasters and the measures taken to avoid and cope with them, as well as possible social disasters and the institutions that work to improve the lives of everyone in the city.</p>

				<p>During our work, we utilized structured and non-structured interviews with key informants such as the head of the fire department, and employees in the geotechnical department in the municipality as well as reading through official reports and risk assessments.  We talked to people on the street and in shops and elsewhere, asking their opinions and letting them tell their story. And lots more.

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>
				We spent three weeks working on this project, with a fourth week at the end to finish the reports that each team was supposed to write as well as writing a final report covering all the work we had done in the project. Other material was also created; a presentation, a short movie, this website and the accompanying interactive map. The movie and website was made because some of the students didn't feel they got to draw upon their field of study when working on the project so they decided to supplement the mandatory deliverables with something they felt would be fun to work on.

The picture above is from the presentation we held at Vår Frue Kirke, where we invited (mostly) everyone we had interviewed and spent time with the preceding weeks and we were positively surprised by the turn-out, especially considering it was early friday afternoon.

The reports and two videos can be found <a href="reports.html">here</a>, and the map can be found below. A fullscreen map is available <a href="map.html">here.</a>
